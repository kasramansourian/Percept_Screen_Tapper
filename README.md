# Screen Tapper & Alert System for Medtronic Percept Devices

This repository contains files for a **customizable screen tapping device** designed for prolonged local field potential (LFP) recordings using the **Medtronic Percept‚Ñ¢ devices**. The system automates screen tapping at varrying intervals and alerts the user when abnormalities are detected via a photodiode sensor.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Device Functionality

The Arduino is programmed using the Arduino IDE and performs the following functions:

- Triggers **Tapper 1(Pin 13)** every **1 hour**, with a 5-second follow-up signal  
- Triggers **Tapper 2(Pin 11)** every **10 minutes**  
- Monitors a **photodiode input** and activates a **buzzer alert** if abnormal activity is detected  

Power is supplied via a 24V wall adapter (with USB conversion), with optional battery pack for backup power.

## üñ• PCB Overview

The PCB includes:
- Two Micro USB-B ports for tapper connections  
- One 6-pin dual-row wire-to-board connector  
- DC barrel jack input  
- Buzzer for photodiode signal alerts  

### 6-Pin Connector Mapping:
- **Top left pin**: Signal to **Top USB Port** (1-hour interval)  
- **Second pin**: Signal to **Bottom USB Port** (10-minute interval)  
- **Bottom right pin**: Shared **ground** for both USB ports, power input, and buzzer  

Soldering was completed in-house using the components listed in the Bill of Materials.

## üß∞ 3D-Printed Casing

The printed case:
- Holds the clinician tablet alongside the Arduino and PCB assembly  
- Includes openings for USB and DC power connections  
- Allows wire access from Arduino to PCB  
- Mounts a flexible photodiode arm at a central screen position for optimal detection  

A **light shield** can slide on the photodiode arm to reduce false alerts from ambient light.

## üíª Programming Notes

- Arduino code is uploaded using the Arduino IDE  
- Adjust timing intervals and photodiode threshold values in the `.ino` script  
- Ensure correct board and COM port are selected during upload
